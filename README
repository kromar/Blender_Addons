MeshPy:
- voronoi: 
    -no its not in, but if you have delauney triangulation, 
    you can get voronoi by connecting the triangle's 
    outer circles midpoints together (at least in 2d)
   
   - New output of Voronoi diagrams. The Voronoi diagram is the geometric dual of the Delaunay triangulation.
    By using the '-v' option, the Voronoi diagram will be saved in files: 
    .v.node, .v.edge, .v.face, and .v.cell.
- For an example, the string '-q1.4q10' sets both a radius-edge ratio (<= 1.4) 
    and a minimum dihedral angle (>= 10 degree) as the tetrahedral shape quality measure
    
- set softbody to split meshes
    - set collision to splits?

- add tetra amount preview option (skipp mesh calculations and just add tetamount to gui)

- add splits to new group
- copy material from source object

- custom name for new tetras 
- human readable tooltips
- reset button resetting slider? separate reset for sliders?

switches 
    - check intersection in meshes with -d switch
    - o2 switch     
    (TetGen generates meshes with quadratic elements if the -o2 switch is specified. 
    Quadratic elements have ten nodes per element, rather than four. 
    The six extra nodes of a tetrahedron fall at the midpoints of its six edges)
    - C switch  to check the consistency of the mesh on finish.
    '-CC', TetGen also checks constrained Delaunay (for -p switch) or conforming Delaunay (for -q, -a, or -i) property for the mesh.
    - h switch for help output
- multiple intersecting meshes causes crash
- modifing a mesh crashes blender; find reason
- convert quality value to percentage, at the moment its inversed logic which is not user friendly

- monkey can not be generated, find reason
    Internal error in finddirectionsub():  Unable to find a subface leading from 73 to 97.
      Please report this bug to sihang@mail.berlios.de. Include the message above, your input data set, and the exact command line you used to run this program, thank you.

- mesh output files?
      
MeshSlicer:
- cant hide vertices directly in edit mode which causes huge performance hit:(
    we have to switch back and forth to modes for every update.....

"version": (1, 0, 0)
    -turned into addon
    - removed double function callable
    - renamed some functions
    - added gui sliders 
    - added gui button to manually slice (can be removed if performance can slice in realtime)
    - sliders and slicing now works via interface
    - fixed minimum slice percentage from 1 to 0
    - removed slice planes (not improving visuals)
    - moved reset to bounding box calculations
    - scale and rotation getting applied on reset (create gui option for this, should be optional)
    - added options to apply scale and rotation to mesh before slicing
    - added second slicer to slice from 2 sides
    - added sliders for 2nd slicer
    - GUI recognizes if type is no mesh
    - added button to reset mesh to working condition
    - marked performance hogs
    - eliminated some performance hogs, cant get rid of switching form object to edit mode and back:(
    - added workaround for quad/tris array problem
    - removed tris convertion of mesh
    - new mesh is set to active
    - source mesh rotation will be applied to generated mesh
    - fixed origin problem if make active was False
    - naming cleanup
    - fixed reset button
    - generate tet now works out of edit mode

"version": (1, 0, 1)
    - option to generate each tetra as separate object
    - checkbox for split
    - added softbody option to splits
    - disabled softbody goal
    - increased push slightly so the tets dont collapse
    - added option to enable/disabel goal on softbody tets
    
"version": (1, 0, 2)
    - added option for game physics
    - code clean up
    
"version": (1, 0, 3)
    - replaced faces with polygons to make compatible with bmesh
    - check for faces to make it work in bmesh and release version
    - added warning message in addons that meshpy modules are required (might not even show when they are missing)

"version": (1, 0, 4)
    - removed old face check
    
"version": (1, 1, 0)
    - added linux module
